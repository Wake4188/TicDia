## The Idea

TicDia transforms the world's largest encyclopedia into a feed you can’t put down.

Swipe through:
- Articles  
- Historical events  
- Surprising facts  
- Words and etymologies  

The same way you'd scroll short-form video — but for knowledge.

No login required to start reading.  
Sign in to unlock personalization, streaks, badges, and saved articles.
